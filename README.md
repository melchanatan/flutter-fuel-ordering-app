## Flutter Fuel Ordering App
This Flutter app can connect and send data to the device via *Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)*.

For context, this app was used to prototype a proof of concept for a Design Thinking project aimed at solving "Fuel station worker mistakenly filled a car with the wrong fuel, damaging the engine and costing the station manager thousands of dollars" (This problem might only be unique to Thai culture).
